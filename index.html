            <h2>Hello there,</h2>
            <p>My name is Stella Usoh, a Nigerian schooling at AltSchool School of Engineering, Frontend Track. My journey in tech is fueled by my passion for learning, coding, and being part of a community that contributes to career growth. Currently, I am an IT Project Manager with a strong interest in transitioning into a full-fledged career in software engineering.</p>

            <h3>Why I Choose AltSchool</h3>
            <p>Altschool for me, was a dream come through. I've always been interested in Computer Science but didn't have the opportunity to study it in the University. So, I choose Altschool to fulfil my long-lived dream. I gained admission in the Tinyuka 2023 session but deferred to the Karatu session. I aspire to graduate as a seasoned and professional Front-end developer and use my skills to solve problems in the software development industry. My goals for AltSchool is to learn both soft and technical skills, make friends, network, be a part of a community, meet people who inspire me in my tech journey, and lastly, be prepared for the world of technology.</p>
